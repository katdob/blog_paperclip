Since moving to New York in 2002, composer, clarinetist, producer and sound engineer [Jeremiah Cymerman] has been described as “an impenitent genre-breaker whose membership among today’s greats must be granted now” (Massimo Ricci, Touching Extremes).  His work has been described as “striking a compelling balance between hallucinatory sound sculpting and the immediacy of improvised music” (Jason Bivins, Dusted Magazine).  Frequently using the recording studio as a primary compositional tool, Cymerman’s work reflects a passionate interest in improvisation, electronic manipulation & production, traditional, studio & graphic composition as well as solo clarinet performance and ensemble performance.  Having worked with a broad range of contemporary artists including Toby Driver, John Zorn, Nate Wooley, Brian Chase, Evan Parker, Mario Diaz de Leon,  Jandek, Anthony Coleman, Joe Morris and Matthew Welch, Cymerman has toured internationally, received numerous commissions and published several articles on music and music production in publications such as Tape-Op magazine and the acclaimed Arcana book series, edited by John Zorn. He has released several recordings of his own music and his recorded output has been documented on the Tzadik and Porter record labels as well as his own, recently launched label, 5049 Records.  From 2013-2015, he was also the host of the weekly music show [The 5049 Podcast].
