----- TO DO:
set January blog content
find out why local has duplicates
fancy up css & layout
why does http://katdob.github.io/blog_paperclip/ display posts ahead of time, but local does not?

----- info:
to run on local host: jekyll serve --baseurl '' --incremental
run locally from gh-pages branch - no need for master
