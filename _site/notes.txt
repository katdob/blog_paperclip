----- TO DO:
fancy up css & layout
ask amanda to make you a nice header + picture

make auto-post on date (so that only posts dated to post that day will post, not future posts)
make clickable calendar of months w/ a list of each month's post upon load of that month
make paginator links pretty

----- info:
to run on local host: jekyll serve --baseurl '' --incremental (remove --incremental if problematic)
run locally from gh-pages branch - no need for master (push from gh-pages branch)
http://katdob.github.io/blog_paperclip/ is url, cannot be only http://katdob.github.io/ because is a Project Site
To add new content move from the post from _futureposts to _posts
